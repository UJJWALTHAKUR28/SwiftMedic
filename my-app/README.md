# SwiftMedic - Emergency Medical Transport App

A Next.js application for emergency medical transport services, connecting users with ambulance drivers.

**Note: This project is still in active development**

Current Status:
- âœ… User/Driver Authentication (Login/Signup) - Fully connected with backend
- âœ… Protected Route Implementation - Complete
- âœ… User/Driver Context Management - Functional
- ðŸš§ Ride Booking Features - In Progress
- ðŸš§ Real-time Location Tracking - In Progress
- ðŸš§ Payment Integration - Pending
- ðŸš§ Live Driver Matching - Using mock data

The core authentication and route protection are fully functional and connected to the backend API. However, the ride booking, tracking, and payment features are currently using placeholder data for development purposes.
